# NeuroCanvas: Multimodal Emotion-to-Art AI Generator

**A revolutionary multimodal LLM system that transforms emotional states and brainwave patterns into dynamic visual art with AI-generated narratives.**

## 🧠 High-Concept Pitch

NeuroCanvas bridges the gap between human consciousness and digital creativity by using advanced multimodal AI to interpret emotional states, simulate brainwave patterns, and generate synchronized visual art with contextual storytelling.

## 🎯 Problem & Solution

Traditional art creation tools require technical skills and can't capture the ephemeral nature of human emotions and thoughts. NeuroCanvas solves this by creating an intuitive interface where users can express their inner world through AI-generated art that responds to their emotional state, accompanied by personalized narratives that give meaning to the visual experience.

## ✨ Core Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Real-time emotion analysis through text input, voice tone, and facial expressions
- **Neuromorphic Art Generation**: AI creates dynamic visual art inspired by simulated brainwave patterns
- **Multimodal Storytelling**: Generates contextual narratives that complement the visual art
- **Interactive Canvas**: Users can influence the art generation through natural language commands
- **Memory Integration**: The system learns user preferences and emotional patterns over time

## 👥 Target User

Creative individuals, therapists, meditation practitioners, and anyone interested in exploring the intersection of technology, consciousness, and art. Perfect for digital artists seeking inspiration, mental health professionals using art therapy, and researchers in human-computer interaction.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask and SocketIO
- **AI/ML**: Transformers, OpenAI API, PyTorch, OpenCV
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Material-UI, Three.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live updates
- **Caching**: Redis for session management

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Redis 6+
- OpenAI API key

### Backend Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zinga18018/NeuroCanvas-AI-Art-Generator.git
cd NeuroCanvas-AI-Art-Generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OpenAI API key to .env
python app.py
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## 🎨 Usage

1. **Start the Application**: Launch both backend and frontend servers
2. **Input Your Emotion**: Describe your current feeling, upload an image, or speak into the microphone
3. **Watch the Magic**: NeuroCanvas generates a unique visual art piece based on your emotional state
4. **Read the Story**: Discover the AI-generated narrative that accompanies your art
5. **Interact & Evolve**: Use natural language to modify the art or generate variations
6. **Save & Share**: Export your creations or share them with the community

## 🧪 Example Interactions

```
User: "I'm feeling nostalgic about my childhood summers"
NeuroCanvas: *Generates warm, golden abstract art with flowing patterns*
Narrative: "In the amber glow of memory, time moves like honey..."

User: "Make it more vibrant and add some blue"
NeuroCanvas: *Transforms the art with electric blues and enhanced saturation*
```

## 🔬 Technical Architecture

- **Emotion Analysis Engine**: Multi-input emotion detection using text sentiment, voice analysis, and computer vision
- **Neuromorphic Art Generator**: Custom neural network inspired by brain connectivity patterns
- **Narrative AI**: Fine-tuned language model for contextual storytelling
- **Real-time Renderer**: WebGL-based visualization engine for smooth art generation
- **Memory System**: Vector database storing user preferences and emotional patterns

## 📊 Performance Metrics
